About graceful degradation and service workers: As we explained in class, graceful degradation is about building your app so that if an advanced feature, such as one that might work on newer iPhones, for instance, doesn't work on older iPhones, then the core experience of the app will still work. Whereas for service workers, it's a concept that takes graceful degradation even further by allowing an app to 'degrade' into a fully offline mode for the app keeping pages and assets for the user. This is something I was able to implement in this lab by creating a local cache similar to what I assume the dinosaur game does when google chrome doesn't detect an internet access available.
